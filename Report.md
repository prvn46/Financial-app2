# Financial-app2
* As  the previous project i have used same langueages as HTML,CSS and Javascript to keep it neat and clean

* As the challenge given to me,i have managed to changethe main logic to print the results and as well the UI of the application

* Instead of using background image unline the previous version i have used much more appealing linear gradient background to enhance the feeilng of using the webapp.

* I have also added a nice and big heading which lets the user know what application they are inside of.

* Also as of the form validation part the user errors are still managed to be kept out as we check in for most common type of errors which can rult into failure of the application.

* The Rest button helps to let the user to clear the form

* The UI is designed in such a way that the result table appears only when the user hits the calculate button with all right inputs,else the tablestays hidden keeping the page neat and tidy.

* Also it is taken care that the user can input the duration in months or years and the app automatically converts the given input to years and months respectively.

* Finally i have to say i had great time trying to complete the challenge as it tested my creativity as well as my capability to adapt quickly to new changes.Thankyou:)
